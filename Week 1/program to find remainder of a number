Write a program to take a number as inout from the user and print the remainder when the no is divided by 10

n = 456
divide 456 by 10
quotient: 45
remiander: 6

/ - division operator 
% - modulo operator ( to get remiander)

456 / 10 - 45
456 % 10 - 6 

a % b remainder when a is divided by b


Code:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x , y;
    cin>>x;
    y = x % 10;
    cout << y;
